So, just a quick blog post as I've just opened my new danielbradley.net blog as a place to write up some of the things I'm doing. This is taking the place of my old [GeeksWithBlogs account](http://geekswithblogs.net/dbradley) as it'll hopefully be a little easier to keep up to date and just write quick posts here.

About the name "The Argumentative Exception": this is just a little play on words about the fact that I'm not really a confrontational person, apart from when talking about software development (or so I'm told)!
